### Reason Why I apply to this company
Technology I dedicate to, Dream I believe, Pioneer to the Future. <br/>
Explain and describe whether the value/meaning of each keyword really exists in the company.

### Career goal I want to achieve at the company
What I want to make/create/advance in the company, not saying "I want to be expert." <br/>
Specify What I want to realize for the dream, the company, and the world.

## Contribution I can do for The company
Perspective / Position / Business <br/>
Carefully think and do not fully seperate them.

I need to think about this part seriously. <br/>
and I have to know if this part is same with part. goal or not and find the specific reason. <br/>
also, I need to know the difference with part. pioneer and specfiy the limitation of it.

### Contribution to the technology 

the field I want to dedicate to is embedded/system sw so I want to write about the contribution to it. <br/>
should I select one of embedded and system sw, if then what I need to know. <br/>

### Contribution to the product with the technology

based on the embedded/system sw technology, I want to write about that what kind of products in which I want to make a contribution. <br/>
same also. <br/>

### Contribution to the business with the product

honestly, I dont know well about what is business. <br/>
but one of goals to do business is growth of the company, I think. <br/>
so, if you allow me to write about this title, under the continuously changing wave of economy, then I want to do that. <br/>

business, I think, it is similar with economy at aspect of wave, considering technology, market and product. <br/>
also, it is similar with economy at aspect of survival, considering consumer, producer. <br/>
at various aspect, considering that there are the limited resources and they want maximum profit on the environments they are, it is similar with economy. <br/>
from the perspective, the activities for business continuously interact with themselves like economy. <br/>

under this condition, as job seeker for engineer, one of the things I can do for business is having confidence about the technology/product will be success and believing their value. <br/>
by doing so, although business and environment is continuously changing, I can overcome the difficulty from it with the company together and achieve the goal.

### Contribution to the future as pioneer [This could be edited, make sure about the perspective]

from population decline in the world, consumption decline from the people, and the economy is down and collapsing, I think, the cycle already has been formed and will be more stronger. <br/>
maybe many people in the world will perceive/understand/feel about this situation just by having a one step to the economy. <br/>
so I think, many leaders in the world argue/suggest to go inside the challenge and the way to bring it to us to overcome this. <br/>

one of the things I like is histroy. <br/>
it has possiblity to understand/predict the direction of cycle but under this situation it is really hard. <br/>
in the macro view, if someone/technology bring us the innovation then I think the history should be changed in new structured-form. <br/>

now, I think, the really important question for the future is that the innovation, whatever it is, has really attraction from reasonable people for economic growth. <br/>
I dont want to talk about the relation between demand and supply and also not to focus on/evaluate the economic value of product based on the innovation. <br/>
but, I think, the time has changed by the situation and under the situation many things. <br/>

so, as job seeker for engineer, what can I do for future especially in perspective of pioneer considering the situation. <br/>
I think, first thing to solve, that is population decline, but it is inevitable and cant be changed. because it is phenomenon naturally caused by the society/system so although it is possible we should accept it as itself. <br/>
next thing is consumption decline, I think, already the answer has comes in. <br/>
last is about economic growth. but, I'm not major in economics so my knowledge about its details is weak. <br/>

lastly, I want to write about this but remind that I'm not economist. <br/>
#### short-term technology/product-centric consumption growth with the social policy. <br/>
#### long-term strategy for our children, for sustainable future for human. <br/>

<br/>

I think, the goal and contribution is different thing absolutely. <br/>
the subjects of it should be different when use the words. <br/>
in the goal, the subject should be focused on me and in the contribution on us. <br/>
I am very sorry about that I didn't notice this importance thing as job seeker. <br/>

as a result, I want to finish this chapter with the end of writing about above 4 titles. <br/>
I think now everything in my hub is looking at the way.

## Related Repository in My Hub
I think it is better to seperate some topics written in here to each repo so that details could be represented, so after write draft of this few of day will be to explain/write for that. <br/>

<p>
- The criteria/meaning of Leader, Pride, Glory. <br/>
- The reason/meaning of Technology, Dream, Pioneer. <br/>
